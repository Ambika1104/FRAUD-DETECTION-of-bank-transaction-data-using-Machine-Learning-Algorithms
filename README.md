# FRAUD-DETECTION-of-bank-transaction-data-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
We have large dataset that consists of different bank transactions. This dataset consists of fraud and no fraud transactions. We have applied various machine learning algorithms (like: logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, gradient boosting &amp; k-NN) to find which model is best fit model to detect the fraud transaction in the dataset.

Worked on 5 machine learning algorithms to check on fraudulent bank transactions and check the working accuracy of all the algorithms.

ALGORITHMS USED TO IMPLEMENT:

- LOGISTIC REGRESSION
- DECISION TREE
- RANDOM FOREST
- GRADIENT BOOSTING
- kNN (K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR)

LANGUAGE USED:
- PYTHON

APPLICATION USED: 
- JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

DATASET WEBSITE:

DOWNLOAD THE DATASET FROM KAGGLE(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection)
Implemented all the algorithms individually. To use the code download the files and run it on Jupiter Notebook. And for vs code install the required libraries on your local pc with command - "pip install library_name".

RESULTS FOUND:

- ACCURACY RATE
- CONFUSION MATRIX
- CLASSIFICATION REPORT
